#OOPS (object oriented programming) IN PYTHON
#to map with real world scenarios we started using objects in code.this is called oop

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#CLASS AND OBJECTS
#class is blueprint for creating objects
#object is instance of class

#example :-
# class Student:
#     name="parvati"

# s1=Student()
# print(s1.name)

# class Car:
#     brand="BMW"
#     color="green"

# car1=Car()
# print(car1.brand)
# print(car1.color)   
#------------------------------------------------------

#CONSTRUCTOR  __init__ function
# all class have function called __init__ which is always executed when the object is being initiated
#
#example:-
